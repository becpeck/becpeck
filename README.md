### Hi, I'm Becca

I'm a full stack developer with a Node/React background. I love Typescript for its elegance, flexibility, power, and [unique weirdness](). When I'm offline, I enjoy climbing, crafting, camping, and cooking. I value openness to experience, curiosity, precision in thought and action, and the beauty of ordered systems.

#### Iâ€™m excited about the ways technology can:
- ðŸ”­ Show, not tell ideas
- ðŸŒ¤ Increase individualsâ€™ agency over their lives and privacy
- ðŸŒ‡ Improve social incentive structures

#### Recent Projects
- [A Set game Monte Carlo simulation](https://replit.com/@andromedis/Set-Game#index.ts) to explore its probabilities and the mathematical patterns revealed
- An overhaul of my resume in HTML/CSS in search of maximum formatting control (blog post in progress)
- [A tag-based music organizer](https://github.com/becpeck/spotify-tagger) using the Spotify API and Next.js (currently blocked on validation for inconsistent API responses, UI to chain tags with Boolean logic, and implementing many-to-many relationships in Prisma, looking for advice)


#### Fun fact: 
I have spent a cumulative year of my living in a tent in the woods.
